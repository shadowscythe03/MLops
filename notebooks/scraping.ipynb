      "Watch: Moment judge sentences Gordon and Marten to at least 14 years\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple have been jailed for 14 years for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter when they went on the run with her to avoid dealing with social services. Constance Marten, 38, and Mark Gordon, 51, were sentenced on Monday after being found guilty in July following a lengthy retrial at the Old Bailey. The decomposed body of their baby, Victoria, was found in a shopping bag in Brighton in 2023. Police had been searching for the couple for 53 days after officers found evidence of a recent birth in a burnt-out car near Bolton. Passing sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft KC told the couple \"neither of you gave much thought to the care or welfare of your baby\" and said there had been \"no genuine expression of remorse\" from either of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were sentenced on the basis Victoria died of hypothermia - both defendants had argued against that during the hearing. Gordon will serve a further four years on extended licence, the judge said. There was no reaction from either defendant as they were sentenced. The first trial found Marten and Gordon guilty of concealing the birth of a child, perverting the course of justice by not reporting her death, and of child cruelty, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge. The court heard that, whem Marten was heavily pregnant, they had decided to live off grid to avoid Victoria being taken off them by social care authorities. Their four other children had previously been taken into care. During the police manhunt that spanned different parts of England once the circumstances of the birth were uncovered, the couple slept outside and took steps to avoid being found, such as taking long taxi rides that criss-crossed the country. They were eventually located on 27 February 2023, and Victoria was discovered dead two days later in an allotment shed in the Hollingbury area of Brighton. She had died while the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs in January that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their trial, the couple had said Victoria's death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep holding the baby - but the prosecution called on evidence from experts on hypothermia, one of whom described the conditions the newborn would have experienced living in a tent in the middle of winter. During a months-long retrial, the judge said the couple tried to \"sabotage\" and \"manipulate\" proceedings. Firstly there were many days when one or other of them claimed illness, dental pain or just tiredness from travelling back and forth to court from their respective jail cells, causing proceedings to overrun by many months. When in court, both displayed disruptive and unpredictable behaviour, disrespected the judge, were rude to dock officers and would often talk during proceedings. On one occasion, Judge Lucraft said about Marten that he has \"never had that sort of attitude\" shown to him by anyone in his 13 years as a full-time judge. During the latter stages of the retrial, Gordon parted company with his legal team and took on the role of representing himself in court, despite having no legal training. Disruption continued during Monday's sentencing hearing, during which the judge told off both defendants for passing notes in the dock. He told them it showed \"a complete lack of respect\".\n",

      "Watch: PM questioned on what he knew and when, about Lord Mandelson\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has said he would \"never\" have appointed Peter Mandelson as his ambassador to the US if he had known the full details of his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In his first comments since sacking Lord Mandelson, Sir Keir said the Labour peer went through a proper due diligence process before his appointment, but he added: \"Had I known then what I know now, I'd have never appointed him.\" Sir Keir gave public backing to Lord Mandelson in the Commons on Wednesday only to sack him the following day. Opposition MPs will get a chance to put further pressure on the government after the Speaker granted the Tories an emergency debate on the appointment on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emails reported by Bloomberg showed supportive messages Lord Mandelson sent to Epstein in 2008 following his guilty plea. The leaked emails included passages in which Lord Mandelson told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He is also reported to have told Epstein \"I think the world of you\" the day before the disgraced financier began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Speaking to reporters, Sir Keir said the messages showed Lord Mandelson \"was not only questioning but wanting to challenge the conviction of Epstein at the time\". Lord Mandelson's emails \"cut across the whole approach that I've taken on violence against women and girls for many years and this government's\", he added. The emails showed \"the nature and extent of the relationship that Peter Mandelson had with Epstein was far different to what I had understood to be the position when I appointed him.\" Sir Keir added he was \"not at all\" satisfied with Lord Mandelson's responses to questions \"put to him by government officials\". The prime minister has faced questions about his judgment in appointing the peer, whose friendship with Epstein was public knowledge, in the first place. The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's leadership and the wider Downing Street operation. Sir Keir insisted he did not know what was in the emails when he defended the US ambassador at Prime Minister's Questions but said he knew Foreign Office officials had asked Lord Mandelson questions about the email.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate in Parliament could prove damaging for Sir Keir's efforts to draw a line under the scandal ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month. Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership. The Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Labour MP Dame Emily Thornberry, has demanded the government give evidence on how Lord Mandelson was cleared and appointed. Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be \"gone\" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour. The Conservatives have also demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment. In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.\n",

      "\"I don't accept that I'm simply jumping ship to save my skin\", says Danny Kruger\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK. Kruger has been an MP since 2019, and sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister. \"The Conservatives are over,\" he told a press conference, sitting alongside Reform party leader Nigel Farage. Kruger said he had been \"honoured\" to be asked to help Reform prepare for government, and said he hoped that Farage would be the next prime minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The East Wiltshire MP - who has said he would not be triggering a by-election - said the Conservatives were no longer the main party of opposition. He said: \"There have been moments when I have been very proud to belong to the Tory party\", but added: \"The rule of our time in office was failure. \"Bigger government, social decline, lower wages, higher taxes and less of what ordinary people actually wanted.\" He added: \"This is my tragic conclusion, the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the left.\" Although he said he had \"great regard\" for Badenoch, he said the Tory party had a \"toxic brand\", adding: \"We have had a year of stasis and drift and the sham unity that comes from not doing anything bold or difficult or controversial.\" Describing his move leaving a party he has been a member of for 20 years as \"personally painful\", he said his \"mission\" with Reform would be to \"not just to overthrow the current system, it is to restore the system we need\". Responding to the news of the defection, Badenoch said: \"Danny has made his case very clear, that this is not about me. \"I can't be distracted by that, and I'm not going to get blown off course by these sort of incidents. \"I know this is the sort of thing that is going to happen while a party is changing. I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\" Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform. Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election. A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, telling MPs in July: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\" Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending. \"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024. Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party. In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair. However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services. His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister. A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\". In 2023, Kruger was one of the speakers at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\". Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute. A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain. \"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\". \"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said. \"It is getting to the point where the only difference between them is just a slightly lighter shade of blue.\"\n",

      "On a scorchingly hot day in the American Midwest, Tim Maxwell is voicing his fears about the future of farming. The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects. \"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company. He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs. \"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\"\n",

      "His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops. American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July. With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening. Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis. Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular.\n",

There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar.

      "\"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine. \"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\" In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China. In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China. Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock. September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year.\n",

      "Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. \"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\" The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser. Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States… \"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke. \"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\"\n",

They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency.

      "Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture. And they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance. In his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\"\n",

      "Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\". \"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\" And it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. But he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts. \"That is a problem.\"\n",

      "There's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances. Yet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump. Experts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole. Though a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small. \"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Iowa's State Fair, many of the conversations revolved around Trump and tariffs (pictured: attendee John Wilson with Judah the Big Ram)\n",
      "\n",
      "For some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run. \"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa. \"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\" Some may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China.\n",
      "\n",
      "A case of selective blame attribution?\n",
      "\n",
      "For Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play. \"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\" Starting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change. What he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloomberg via Getty Images Rural America: the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump, says one expert\n",
      "\n",
      "Some repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\". \"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". Ms Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\" Prof Shepherd, of Michigan University, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side. He calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'We're giving him a chance - there'd better be results'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\" But he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return. Many of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support.\n",

      "'A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,' farmer Gil Gullickson (left). 'But history proves that tariffs don't end well'\n",

      "Mr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under. Back at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear. \"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less. \"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\" Listen to Corn Belt People on BBC Radio 4 at 4pm bst on Monday 15 September\n",

      "When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks. Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode. This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness. Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, and conditions such as long Covid and autoimmune conditions like lupus disease, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind at once. Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Be kind to yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping. Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched. Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it. If you are concerned then you should contact your GP.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create routines\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory. Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\" It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Take breaks\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Taking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focus\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room. But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely. Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly. Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use calendars and reminders\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness. Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space. Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores. This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\"\n",

But a lot of the most famous examples - including that 90s girlband masterpiece - weren't actually shot continuously in real life. They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been. One of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards, was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption. It's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March. Audiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama. Its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world. The Emmy winners and nominations in full\n",

      "\n",
      "The drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed. Cooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode. They find him in his bedroom and place him under arrest. \"You're making a big mistake,\" insists the boy's dad, played by Stephen Graham, who also co-created the series with writer Jack Thorne. But as the episode unfolds, it's clear there is no mistake. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately proves Jamie's guilt, and Adolescence begins to examine its key questions: what led to this murder, and what motive could a teenager possibly have had. It was a storyline based on real events. \"I read an article about a young boy who'd stabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" Graham told Radio X's Chris Moyles. A similar but separate teen stabbing hit the headlines just a couple of months later. \"And these two incidents were at the opposite ends of the country,\" Graham noted. \"And I just thought, why is this happening? And not just because I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compass can look at that situation and think, what's going on with society today that we're in this era where these young boys are stabbing young girls to death?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix Stephen Graham (right) co-created the series with Jack Thorne, and also stars as Jamie's dad\n",
      "\n",
      "Graham knew the success of the show would hinge on the young actor chosen to play Jamie, and casting director Shaheen Baig struck gold with Cooper - who had first become interested in acting around the age of 10. In a joint interview with Baig, Cooper explained: \"I don't know where it came from, but I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer. \"I still play football now, and then asking them if I wanted to start drama lessons, it was a bit out of the blue, really.\" Baig recalled: \"It was really [about] trying to find somebody with the emotional register to be able to play Jamie. \"Owen sent us an improv tape, and I remember first watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart.\" It felt very natural.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Casting director Shaheen Baig said Cooper had seemed \"very natural\" in his audition tape\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the headlines surrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wasn't actually true. \"It has frustrated us a bit,\" said drama teacher Esther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting classes Cooper had attended for two years in Didsbury, Manchester. The Adolescence team, she told BBC News in April, had approached the Drama MOB school while casting the series, asking to see tapes of their \"strongest northern boys\". \"They kept coming back for Owen,\" she recalled. \"He just had something.\" It was true that Cooper didn't have any TV or film credits to his name, but not that he had never tried his hand at acting. In fact, Morgan suggested Cooper's comfort with one-take shooting was partly due to the drama school's focus on improvisation. When the show launched, Morgan said: \"It felt amazing, but I didn't realise it would be as good as it was, I didn't expect it to be talked about so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For several weeks, the series dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday). \"We wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament,\" Thorne said. The government subsequently supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised. Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood\" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh. It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\" Clearly, Emmy voters didn't forget about it either. The show's impact was so undeniable that it was seen as the dead-cert for best limited series. Even Colin Farrell's painful months spent in a hot and heavy bodysuit and under acres of prosthetics for Batman spin-off The Penguin were no match for it. Adolescence's victory this year continues Netflix's winning streak, after another of their other watercooler hits, Baby Reindeer, took home several prizes in 2024.\n",

Several scenes from the series went viral, from the initial arrest at the beginning to the camera that follows a pupil fleeing the classroom out of a window in episode two. Both moments were enhanced by the one-take shooting style. \"The choreography of camera and bodies, should you care to contemplate it, is remarkable, navigating crowds and corridors and public places with impossible grace,\" noted the LA Times. \"Long, uninterrupted scenes also allow a superb cast to dive into character and the moment.\" But the show's third episode, a chamber piece where Jamie spends an hour with a child psychologist, was perhaps the highlight. Hardly any other characters appear as Briony (played by Erin Doherty) gently probes Jamie. Cooper runs the full acting gauntlet - veering from vulnerable to furious, cocky to distraught. Bearing in mind that Cooper only appears on screen in two of Adolescence's four episodes, it was probably this performance which sealed his Emmy.\n",

It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea. The \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag. The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars.

Speaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams.

      "British actor Owen Cooper has become the youngest male ever to win a primetime Emmy Award, in a night dominated by Netflix's acclaimed drama Adolescence. Cooper, 15, was named best supporting actor in a limited series for his portrayal of a schoolboy accused of murdering a classmate. The four-part drama also won best limited series, as well as prizes for its directing and writing, and acting prizes for Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty. In his acceptance speech, Cooper said: \"Standing up here is just, wow, it's just so surreal.\n",

Anything can be possible. I was nothing about three years ago, I'm here now.\" He also thanked his family, co-stars, and the show's production team, adding: \"It may have my name on this award, but it really belongs to the people behind the camera.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Warning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts A man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation. Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of the UK you can watch on YouTube\n",

      "One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda\n",
      "\n",
      "Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n",

      "Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Troy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa\n",
      "\n",
      "He says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n",

      "Instagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died\n",
      "\n",
      "Monic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n",

      "Kayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n",

      "When Shahnaz went into labour, her husband Abdul called a taxi to take them to the only medical facility accessible to them. \"She was in a lot pain,\" he says. A 20-minute drive away, the clinic was in Shesh Pol village in Afghanistan's north-eastern Badakhshan province. It was where their two older children were born. Abdul sat next to Shahnaz comforting her as they drove over gravel tracks to reach help. \"But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed. I didn't know it had shut down,\" he said, his face crumpling with agony. Warning: Readers may find some details in this article distressing. The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). A single-storey structure with four small rooms, white paint peeling off its walls, the Shesh Pol clinic has USAID posters tacked up everywhere with information and guidance for pregnant women and new mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aakriti Thapar / BBC Shesh Pol maternity clinic is one of hundreds of medical facilities forced to close as a result of US aid cuts in Afghanistan\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider programme implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths. It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month. It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services. Other medical facilities are simply too far from Abdul's village, and it was not without risk for Shahnaz to travel on bumpy roads. Abdul also didn't have money to pay for a longer journey - renting the taxi cost 1,000 Afghani ($14.65; £12.70), roughly a quarter of his monthly income as a labourer. So they decided to return home. \"But the baby was coming and we had to stop by the side of the road,\" Abdul said. Shahnaz delivered their baby girl in the car. Shortly after, she died, bleeding profusely. A few hours later, before she could be named, their baby also died.\n",

      "Aakriti Thapar / BBC Abdul spoke to the BBC about the traumatic deaths of his wife and newborn baby, who are buried in Shesh Pol\n",

      "\"I wept and screamed. My wife and child could've been saved if the clinic was open,\" said Abdul. \"We had a hard life, but we were living it together. I was always happy when I was with her.\" He doesn't even have a photo of Shahnaz to hold on to. There's no certainty the mother and baby would've survived if they'd been treated at the clinic, but without it, they didn't stand a chance, underlining the undeniable impact of US aid cuts in Afghanistan. For decades, America has been the largest donor to Afghanistan, and in 2024, US funds made up a staggering 43% of all aid coming into the country. The Trump administration has justified withdrawing it, saying there were \"credible and longstanding concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including... the Taliban\", who govern the country. The US government further added that they had reports stating that at least $11m were \"being siphoned or enriching the Taliban\". The report that the US State Department referenced was made by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). It said that $10.9m of US taxpayer money had been paid to the Taliban-controlled government by partners of USAID in \"taxes, fees, duties, or utilities\". The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands. \"This allegation is not true. The aid is given to the UN, and through them to NGOs in provinces. They identify who needs the aid, and they distribute it themselves. The government is not involved,\" said Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha.\n",

Neither are countless others. The BBC has documented at least half a dozen first-hand, devastating accounts in areas where USAID-supported clinics have shut down. Right next to Shahnaz's grave, villagers who had gathered around us pointed to two other graves. They told us both were of women who died in childbirth in the past four months – Daulat Begi and Javhar. Their babies survived. Not far from the graveyard, we met Khan Mohammad whose wife, 36-year-old Gul Jan, died in childbirth five months ago. Their baby boy Safiullah died three days later.\n",

Now we have $25,000,\" Dr Hamdard said. By August this year, there had been as many maternal deaths recorded as there were for the whole of last year. Which means that at this rate, maternal mortality could increase by as much as 50% over last year. Newborn deaths have already increased by roughly a third in the past four months, compared with the start of the year.

      "Bloomberg via Getty Images Mark Carney became the first new Canadian prime minister in nine years when he was elected six months ago\n",
      "\n",
      "A trade war with its largest economic partner, a faltering economy - and a lot of promises to deliver on. These are only some of the high-stake tests facing Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney as parliament returns for the autumn sitting on Monday. Here is a look at some of the political pressures on his Liberal government's horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voters want action on lofty pledges\n",
      "\n",
      "Carney's Liberals made a series of lofty promises during the recent election campaign, from making Canada's economy the strongest in the G7 to \"turbo-charging\" major infrastructure projects and massively ramping up housing development. Now, voters are ready to see progress. Canadians \"will be looking for clear actions that make a difference, and that's where the rubber will really hit the road for Mark Carney\", said Sébastien Dallaire, an executive vice-president with polling firm Leger. There has been some movement on big issues. Last week, the prime minister unveiled the first series of \"nation-building\" projects that Ottawa will review for fast-track approvals - a key part of his wider economic agenda. They include a plan to double production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a British Columbia plant, the expansion of part of Montreal's port, and building a small modular nuclear reactor in Ontario. Carney has also announced $13bn (£6.9bn, $9.4bn) for a new federal housing agency to help build new homes, and vowed to diversify trade away from the US. In politics it's usually prudent to under-promise and over-deliver, said Marci Surkes, chief strategy officer at public affairs firm Compass Rose and a former policy director to Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau. \"Mr Carney has taken quite a different tack, where he has really set the bar very high in terms of expectations,\" she said. She added: \"There's already impatience from those who are waiting to see results.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic woes surpass Trump fears\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety around an unpredictable US president helped propel Carney to power last April. Donald Trump has since imposed punishing tariffs on some sectors of the economy, like steel and autos, but has granted a majority of Canadian goods a broad tariff exemption under the current US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal. Mr Dallaire said Canadians know it won't be \"an easy ride\" for the next few years. \"The question has turned to: 'OK, what now?'\" Recent opinion polling suggests that voters are feeling less panicked by Trump but increasingly worried about the economy. Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.1% last month, a level not seen since 2016, excluding the pandemic, and economic growth slowed sharply over the summer, contracting by 1.6%. A poll released by Abacus Data this month indicates that six in 10 respondents felt the Ottawa government was too focused on the US president at the expense of pressing concerns like housing, healthcare, and affordability. Still, for Carney, there's some silver lining. Many don't blame him directly for the economic shocks of Trump's policies - but they will be watching how the prime minister navigates what he has called a \"rupture\" in the global economy. \"A souring economy will become a drag on the popularity of the government, but it really depends to what extent it happens and to what extent Canadians see visible changes,\" said Mr Dallaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "An opposition leader back in the saddle\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre Poilievre is making his return to the House of Commons. The Conservative leader lost his long-held seat in the April election to a Liberal challenger and was forced to spend his summer seeking a path back to parliament. In August, he won a by-election in Alberta, securing a new seat and a chance to be a foil for Carney in the House. \"The real fighting match is about to begin, and Mr Carney is going to have to swat away or figure out how to handle the punches that will be coming at him,\" said Ms Surkes. In an open letter to Carney last week, Poilievre set the stage, saying: \"So far, you have been judged only by the lofty things you have promised to do one day, not by what you have done.\" Poilievre has sharply focused his message on cost-of-living and crime issues and he plans to target the Liberals - who have been in power since 2015 - on their record, as well as on immigration. That includes pushing them on the number of temporary foreign workers allowed into the country, a programme that has seen a significant expansion in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "An 'austerity' warning\n",
      "\n",
      "An \"austerity and investment\" federal budget is expected later this autumn - a financial balancing act Carney has said is possible with \"discipline\". The prime minister has criticised government spending under Trudeau as \"unsustainable\" and has asked his finance minister to find programme spending cuts across departments that would increase to 15% reductions over the next three years. \"We need to rein in spending. We need to find efficiencies,\" Carney has said. But the prime minister will also have to find a way to deliver on major commitments, including a multi-billion dollar increase in defence spending promised to Nato partners, notably the US. It comes amid lower revenues from tariffs and other financial challenges, likely leaving officials \"shaking every couch cushion loose for change\", said Ms Surkes. \"Here we have a circumstance where the government is trying to walk and chew gum at the same time, if you will - where it is both trying to identify cuts and restraint, but also has committed publicly to some very significant investments,\" she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out further strikes on Hamas leaders following last week's attack in Qatar, saying they would not have immunity \"wherever they are\". Speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\". Israel's decision to target Hamas leaders in Qatar - a close US ally - drew international outrage and criticism from US President Donald Trump. Hamas said six people were killed but that its leaders survived. Netanyahu's comments come days after the White House said Trump had assured Qatar \"that such a thing will not happen again on their soil\".\n",
      "\n",
      "When pressed on whether the US had any involvement in the strike, Netanyahu told journalists: \"We did it on our own. Period.\" In response to a BBC question about whether the strike had damaged US relations in the region, Rubio said Washington maintained \"strong relationships with our Gulf allies\". The pair presented a broadly united front, even amid the apparent tensions, with Rubio praising the two countries' technological and cultural ties - and Netanyahu saying Israel had \"no better ally\". Their meeting comes as Arab leaders hold a summit in a show of support for Qatar. The Qatari prime minister urged the international community to stop applying \"double standards\" and to punish Israel.\n",

      "Qatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel. It has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012. According to a State Department official, Rubio will travel on to Qatar following his Israel trip. On Sunday, Netanyahu told reporters that the US-Israel relationship was as \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\" while he and Rubio made a short visit to the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City. During the trip - on which they were accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee - Rubio wrote a note and placed it into the wall, a traditional ritual performed by visitors. The men ignored reporters' questions focusing on Israel's strikes in Qatar. Also thought to have been discussed by Netanyahu and Rubio are Israeli military plans to seize Gaza City and Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Over the weekend, the Israeli military pressed ahead with the demolition of residential buildings in Gaza City, and - according to local media - is now poised to begin ground operations in the Western neighbourhoods of the city. It has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Some say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City. \"They are asking us to leave our homes, as if they're asking us to go on a trip,\" said Gaza City resident Hafez Habous. \"Here in Gaza we will die for one reason: we simply have no money. We have no tents, no makeshift shelters, and transport is unavailable.\" \"If you speak to a driver to go south he asks for 300 shekels,\" he said - the equivalent of about $90 or £65. \"How come? I don't even have 100. I don't even have money for tomorrow's food. So how can we move south?\"\n",

      "The father of a Cardiff man who has spent 20 years in prison after stealing a mobile phone has said his son has served a \"life sentence\" behind bars. Leroy Douglas, 44, was handed a minimum term of two-and-a-half years in 2005 for robbery, but remains in custody as he is subject to an indeterminate sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). The controversial measure was scrapped in 2012, but campaigners are calling for those currently serving an IPP to be resentenced and have filed a case against the UK before the United Nations. The Ministry of Justice said it released the highest annual number of IPP prisoners on record last year with additional support given to those in custody.\n",

      "IPPs are a type of sentence which means inmates can be detained indefinitely if the parole board decides it is not safe to release them. They were designed to detain offenders who posed a \"significant\" risk of causing serious harm to the public, but faced criticism after being handed out for less serious crimes. Defendants must serve a minimum term before being considered for release by the parole board but this is not automatic. They are also subject to licence conditions which they must follow or risk being recalled to prison once they are released.\n",

However, he said it \"all escalated\" when the dad-of-two was sentenced for stealing a mobile phone belonging to his cousin's boyfriend in 2005. Instead of a fixed term two and a half year custody sentence, he was handed an IPP, which his family said was a \"shock to everyone\". \"He got two-and-a-half years and the next thing I know is that he's still in there all these years later,\" Mr Douglas said. \"I expected him to do half of the two-and-a-half years and start fresh again.\"\n",

While in custody, Leroy Douglas had to be told of his daughter's death after she suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage aged 20, as well as losing his grandparents and other family members, something which his dad said had affected his mental health. According to Mr Douglas he has been moved to different facilities a number of times, which has resulted in him having to repeat training and courses needed for him to be considered for release. \"We are not the only ones suffering, the whole family is with him being in prison,\" he said.\n",

Many subjected to them get recalled sometimes for the most minor sentences.\" Mr Taylor said there needed to be a \"large scale resentencing\" of people who were subject to IPPs. While he said not all those subject to them would otherwise have been released immediately, \"there was no longer a need to have people locked up like this\". \"These people become hopeless, they have no hope on getting out which can lead to violent behaviour in prisons, and we have a radical shortage of prison spaces,\" he said. \"The first aim of prison should be rehabilitation, and IPP sentences go against that.\"\n",

The group have also filed a case against the UK government before the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. In the letter, the campaigners urged the government to \"do the right thing by ending one of the greatest miscarriages of justice and restore hope and justice to thousands of IPP prisoners and their families\".

      "AFP/GETTY Christopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spies\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors have dropped charges against two men, including a former parliamentary researcher, who had been accused of spying for China. Christopher Cash, 30, and Christopher Berry, 33, had previously denied the charges under the Official Secrets Act. Beijing has called the allegations \"malicious slander\". The two men were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between 28 December 2021 and 3 February 2023. Speaking outside the Old Bailey following the decision to cease legal proceedings on Monday, Mr Cash said he was \"relieved that justice has been served\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He described the two years since his arrest as a \"nightmare\" and said he hoped \"lessons are learned from this sorry episode\". Prosecutor Tom Little told the the court that his team would offer no evidence against the men and that \"we simply cannot continue to prosecute this case\". The court heard that the Crown Prosecution Service had determined the evidence it had gathered did not meet the threshold to go to trial. The pair were due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court from 6 October. The Home Office said it was \"disappointing that they will not face trial given the seriousness of the allegations\". \"We will continue to use the full range of tools and powers to guard against malign activity,\" it added in a statement. Mr Berry, a teacher from Witney in Oxfordshire, and Mr Cash, of Whitechapel in London, were arrested in March 2023 as part of an investigation that involved counter-terror police. They were accused of collecting information which was \"calculated to be, might be, or were intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy\". It had been reported that Mr Cash was involved with Parliament's China Research Group (CRG). He was understood to have had access to several Conservative MPs, reportedly including former security minister Tom Tugendhat and then-foreign affairs committee chairwoman Alicia Kearns.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some of the families have severely criticised the review and Streeting's handling of it, describing the investigation as \"not fit for purpose\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said bereaved families had shown \"extraordinary courage\" in coming forward with issues dating back more than 15 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquiries are part of a rapid review of maternity care in England that was announced in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourteen NHS trusts are to have their maternity services examined over what has been described as \"failures in the system\", the government has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NHS trusts that will be examined are:\n",
      "\n",
      "There will also be \"particular attention\" paid to examining why black and Asian families have noticeably poorer outcomes, Baroness Amos said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Past inquiries have revealed issues including ignoring women's voices, poor leadership, a failure to learn from safety incidents and a toxic culture. Yet families are still repeatedly reporting substandard care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The review will examine the experience of families and staff within England's struggling maternity services and investigate why the recommendations from previous maternity inquiries in Morecambe Bay, East Kent, and Shrewsbury and Telford have not led to sustained improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The review was due to be completed by December, but will now not report until Spring 2026. Baroness Amos says she will aim to produce interim findings around Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Streeting opted for the rapid review instead of a national inquiry into maternity care, which many families have been calling for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved maternity care may have prevented the deaths of over 800 babies lives in 2022-23, according to research by the baby loss charities Sands and Tommy's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She added that the current situation - in which trusts had been investigated already and \"hundreds\" of recommendations made, yet fresh reviews were required - was \"completely unacceptable\".\n",
      "\n",
      "She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she hoped the review would help families \"get the justice that they want and that they deserve\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Baroness Amos, who will chair the review, said she was committed to ensuring families affected by maternity care failures were heard and that the 14 investigations would lead to improvements nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Health said the trusts had been chosen based on data analysis and the views of families, as well as to ensure a geographical and demographic mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the focus on these trusts would \"create real anxiety among women, families and staff\" at the 14 trusts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It added that the review would need to re-build a world class maternity system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too many women and babies are not getting the safe, compassionate care they deserve and the maternity workforce is on its knees, with staff leaving the profession,\" said the college's president, Prof Ranee Thakar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strongest criticism of the review, however, comes from the Maternity Safety Alliance (MSA) - a group of families harmed by poor maternity care in several NHS trusts across England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having engaged in a number of meetings with the Department of Health in recent weeks, they said Streeting had \"broken promises\" over how the investigation would be run and what it would examine, and that they had been left feeling \"used\".\n",
      "\n",
      "They are particularly critical of the decision not to investigate the role of NHS regulators, such as the Care Quality Commission and NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance and litigation arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The review seems to have already decided that all the responsibility for these 800 deaths a year lies squarely with NHS trusts and the clinicians who work in them,\" said Tom Hender, who lost his son Aubrey in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just not true - the whole system is in crisis and we need a whole system approach.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The MSA said the investigation was \"not fit for purpose\" and will not achieve what Streeting said it would, adding: \"It is clear that only a statutory public inquiry can end the crisis in maternity care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Baroness Amos said the terms of the review were extensive given its time frame and that regulatory bodies were \"not excluded\", but added: \"The kind of in-depth review that is being requested is not something that I am able to conduct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two families who successfully campaigned for an investigation into maternity care in Shrewsbury and Telford are more positive about the review, describing it as \"an important and brave first step\".\n",
      "\n",
      "But the parents of Kate Stanton-Davies and Pippa Griffiths also said it would be \"safer\" if the review proceeded at a slower pace, adding that proper mental health support had to be provided to those families sharing their experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not enough to have a nominal support figure in the room and an email address for follow-up,\" they said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing challenges facing maternity services were highlighted last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, a review of care at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS trust found that the deaths of nine babies between 2020 and 2023 could have been prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then on Friday, a report found that NHS trusts rated over half their maternity and neonatal buildings as being unsatisfactory, with 7% saying they ran a serious risk of imminent breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the chief executive of the doctor's regulator, the General Medical Council, is expected to say that a \"toxic\" culture of cover-up in the NHS was leading to poor maternity outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
